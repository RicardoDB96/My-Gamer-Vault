# My Gamer Vault
My Gamer Vault is an application to register and organize your video game collection with ease and a variety of options.
This app was my second project on Android Development, develop in a single month on June 2022.

## Main features
- Add your video games and organize them into different categories, such as the game I want to play, playing or game played, where you can put a rating based on your experience with the game and an opinion. You can also add which platforms you'll be playing on and a cover image of the game. 
- You will be able to see the specific information of each game in addition to being able to edit it or mark it as one of your favorites. 
- In your profile, you will be able to see some statistics about your games in addition to seeing a list with your games marked as favorites.
